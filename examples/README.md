# Examples Overview #

## Folder `dmc_objects/` ##

* **Corona-Graphics-Fishies**

	This is a conversion of the example `Graphics/Fishies` which comes with Corona SDK.

	_Care was taken to retain the variable names and logic so that it would be easier to see how the code for `Fishies` was split up to become object-oriented._

	Tags: Corona Example, OOP, Factory Pattern.


* **Corona-Physics-ManyCrates**

	This is a conversion of the example `Physics/ManyCrates` which comes with Corona SDK.

	_Care was taken to retain the variable names and logic so that it would be easier to see how the code for `ManyCrates` was split up to become object-oriented._

	Tags: Corona Example, OOP, inheritance, Factory Pattern.


* **DMC-MultiShapes**

	Press the button and shapes get drawn and placed randomly on the display using the Corona drawing primitives.

	_This example shows multi-level single-inheritance, simple use of the `dmc_buttons` lib, and use of the Factory Pattern for object creation._

	Tags: OOD/OOP, inheritance, Factory Pattern.


* **DMC-ufo**

	UFOs fly randomly around the screen. They turn different colors depending on their speed - the faster they go, the hotter the ship's material becomes.

	_This is a simple, but complete example of using `dmc_objects`._

## Folder `dmc_buttons/` ##

* **dmc-AppTabNav**

	This is an example of using the Radio Group to create tab navigation for a mobile app.

	_Even though we're using the Director library to switch screens, we control layering so that we only create one button group, but still retain Director functionality._

	Tags: Director, Radio Group, custom buttons




## Folder `dmc_trajectory/` ##

* **DMC-trajectory-basic**

	Shows simple trajectory with a single object.

	Tags: ballistic trajectory

* **DMC-trajectory-multiple**

	This is an example which shows three projectiles being simultaneously fired around a 3x3 grid.

	Tags: ballistic trajectory

* **DMC-trajectory-direction**

	Shows example of how to setup dmc_trajectory with objects that face either left or right.

	Tags: ballistic trajectory
