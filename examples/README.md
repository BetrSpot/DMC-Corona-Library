Here are the details:

### dmc_objects.lua ###

This file contains several methods and object classes which together form an object-oriented framework to use when programming in Lua with Corona SDK.  _**Though it's not just for Corona - the top-level object classes can be used when developing software in plain Lua.**_

When doing OOP, these classes provide:

* **a classical model of object oriented programming**

	`dmc_objects` is structured after the classical inheritance model, thus is easy to learn and use by people with varying levels of experience. This also helps give a solid organizational structure when using a language that is relatively unstructured.

* **a simple structure for doing OOP in Lua and Corona SDK**

	The framework also abstracts the details of doing inheritance in Lua so that both experienced and inexperienced users of the language can focus on the code being written, and not the gory details of the language - ie, there is no need to learn about Lua `metatables` until you want to know. All of that is taken care of so you can get things done.
