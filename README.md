This file is a small, but growing list of helpful utility functions. At the moment they are mostly concerned with tables.
It provides these functions:

* extend() - similar to jQuery extend()
* hasOwnProperty() - similar to JavaScript hasOwnProperty
* propertyIn() - check property existence in a list
* destroy() - generic table destruction
* print() - multi-level object printing
